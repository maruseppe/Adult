    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By far the most common way to represent categorical variables is using the one-hotencoding\n",
    "or one-out-of-N encoding, also known as dummy variables. The idea behind\n",
    "dummy variables is to replace a categorical variable with one or more new features\n",
    "that can have the values 0 and 1. The values 0 and 1 make sense in the formula for\n",
    "linear binary classification (and for all other models in scikit-learn), and we can\n",
    "represent any number of categories by introducing one new feature per category. Employee\", \"Private Employee\", \"Self Employed\", and \"Self Employed Incorpo\n",
    "rated\". To encode these four possible values, we create four new features, called \"Gov\n",
    "ernment Employee\", \"Private Employee\", \"Self Employed\", and \"Self Employed\n",
    "Incorporated\". A feature is 1 if workclass for this person has the corresponding\n",
    "value and 0 otherwise, so exactly one of the four new features will be 1 for each data\n",
    "point. This is why this is called one-hot or one-out-of-N encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to\n",
    "check the contents of a column is using the value_counts function of a pandas\n",
    "Series (the type of a single column in a DataFrame), to show us what the unique values\n",
    "are and how often they appear. We can see from the result pf the following code that there are exactly two values for gender in this dataset, Male and\n",
    "Female, meaning the data is already in a good format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very simple way to encode the data in pandas, using the get_dummies function.\n",
    "The get_dummies function automatically transforms all columns that have\n",
    "object type (like strings) or are categorical. It is also important to call get_dummies on a DataFrame containing\n",
    "both the training and the test data. This ensures that categorical values are represented in the same way in the training set\n",
    "and the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we can use the values attribute to convert the data_dummies DataFrame into a\n",
    "NumPy array, so that a machine learning model can be trained on it. Be careful to separate\n",
